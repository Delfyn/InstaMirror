This is experimental branch, for some tests, in most cases it will not probabbly work, so, its **better** stay on **master** 

### TODO (in this order)

- [x] Login
- [x] Unfollow (maybe better to save before unfollow)
- [ ] Get remote following
- [ ] Follow remote following
- [ ] Save yours following to file
- [ ] Follow from file
- [ ] ???









### Right now :

##### Logging
- Terminal output
- Txt file

##### Get following list
- Get your followings to txt file and **refollow** them, whenever you want

#### Thats all for now, when everything will works, checkout master branch :)
